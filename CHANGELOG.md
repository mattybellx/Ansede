# Changelog

All notable changes to ansede-static are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Inline suppression** — `# ansede: ignore` or `# ansede: ignore[CWE-862]` on any line to suppress findings. Works in both Python (`#`) and JavaScript (`//`) comments.
- **`--baseline` flag** — pass a previous JSON report to only show *new* findings. Ideal for CI diff-scanning on PRs.
- **CWE-862 body-mutation analysis** — the missing-auth rule now inspects function bodies for state-mutating calls (db.commit, .save, .delete, etc.) to distinguish truly risky unprotected routes from harmless read-only endpoints.
- New public-route patterns: `/index`, `/home`, `/about`, `/terms`, `/privacy`, `/api/docs`, `/swagger`, `/healthz`, `/readiness`, and more.
- Resource-ID detection in route paths (`<int:id>`, `<uuid:pk>`) — these routes are flagged HIGH even on GET since they access specific resources.
- Community files: CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, issue templates.
- Versioned JSON report envelopes with aggregate summaries.
- Intermediate finding IR scaffolding and a zero-dependency SQLite cache module.
- VS Code extension protocol/runner helpers plus extension build validation in CI.
- JavaScript route-level **CWE-639 IDOR** and **CWE-285 missing ownership** heuristics for Express/Router handlers using resource IDs without owner scoping.
- Trace-aware evidence for JS access-control findings, including route, resource parameter, auth middleware, missing guard, and sink steps.
- JavaScript route-aware **CWE-862 missing authentication**, **CWE-285 broken admin access control**, and **CWE-287 auth bypass via presence-only credential checks** heuristics.
- Three new synthetic JS benchmark cases covering missing auth, broken admin access control, and presence-only auth bypass.
- New synthetic Python benchmark case covering an admin route protected only by authentication with no privilege check.
- Finding metadata now carries `analysis_kind` through JSON/SARIF/IR/VS Code surfaces so downstream tooling can distinguish direct patterns from heuristic route or taint findings.
- Findings now carry stable analyzer-specific `rule_id` values (for example `PY-024`, `JS-034`) through JSON, SARIF, IR, CLI baseline matching, and VS Code diagnostics.

### Changed
- **CWE-862 false-positive reduction** — pure GET routes with no state mutation and no resource IDs in the path are no longer flagged. POST/PUT/DELETE routes and routes with resource IDs are still flagged as HIGH. Admin routes remain CRITICAL.
- JSON examples and downstream integrations now use the top-level report envelope (`results`, `summary`, `schema_version`) instead of assuming a raw array.
- README capability framing now documents current JS/Python scope, synthetic benchmark limits, and the expanded 26-case benchmark corpus.
- Python admin access-control detection now recognizes explicit inline privilege guards such as `if not current_user.is_admin: abort(403)`, role comparisons, and helper calls like `require_admin(...)`, reducing false positives while preserving auth-only admin route detection.
- Route- and taint-derived findings now emit calibrated confidence scores and expose their provenance in verbose text, JSON, SARIF, and VS Code diagnostics.
- SARIF rule emission no longer collapses distinct findings under plain CWE IDs when the analyzer has a more specific stable detector ID.

### Fixed
- GitHub Action finding counts now parse the JSON envelope correctly.
- VS Code extension scans now stream document contents over stdin instead of assuming child-process input wiring that never happened.

## [1.1.0] — 2025-01-XX

### Added
- 20 modular rule functions (`_rule_01` through `_rule_20`) replacing the monolithic `_detect()` function.
- `_Ctx` dataclass for shared analysis context.
- Pre-commit hook configuration (`.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`).
- GitHub Actions composite action (`action.yml`).
- CI workflow testing Python 3.9–3.13.
- Benchmarks and synthetic CVE-pattern corpus under `benchmarks/`.

### Changed
- `_detect()` cyclomatic complexity reduced from 308 to ~15.

### Fixed
- `except Exception: pass` in js_analyzer.py now logs with `_log.debug()`.
- Benchmark Unicode encoding on Windows (UTF-8 reconfigure).
- `_ownership_re` shared-scope leak and `ctx` variable shadowing in rule functions.

## [1.0.0] — 2025-01-XX
